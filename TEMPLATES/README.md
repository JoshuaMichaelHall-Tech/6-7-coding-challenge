# Your 6/7 Coding Challenge

This repository was created from the [6/7 Coding Challenge](https://github.com/joshuamichaelhall-tech/6-7-coding-challenge) template. It's your personalized commitment to code for 500 days (or your custom duration), six days a week, while observing the Sabbath rest on Sundays.

## Getting Started

After creating this repository from the template, follow these steps:

1. Clone your new repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
   cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
   ```

2. Run the installer to set up your personalized challenge:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/bin
   cp scripts/cc-installer.rb ~/bin/
   chmod +x ~/bin/cc-installer.rb
   ruby ~/bin/cc-installer.rb
   ```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to customize your challenge

4. Start your first day:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ccstart
   ```

## Your Challenge, Your Way

The template lets you customize:

- Your name and GitHub information
- Project locations and directories
- Programming languages and technologies for each phase
- Schedule (days per week, days per phase, total days)
- Development tools (editor, use of tmux, etc.)

## Tracking Your Progress

Run `ccstatus` to view your current progress, estimated completion date, and other statistics.
