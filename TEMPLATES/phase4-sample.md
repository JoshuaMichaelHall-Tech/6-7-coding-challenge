# Day X - Phase 4: Capstone (Week XX)

## Today's Focus
- [ ] Primary goal: Implement real-time analytics dashboard using WebSockets
- [ ] Secondary goal: Optimize performance of data aggregation queries
- [ ] Stretch goal: Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Launch School Connection
- Current course: LS490 - Capstone Project
- Concept application: Real-time data processing and performance optimization

## Project Context
This capstone project is the full implementation of the social media analytics platform. Today's work focuses on adding real-time capabilities to the analytics dashboard and optimizing performance.

## Tools & Technologies
- React for frontend
- Node.js with Express for backend
- PostgreSQL for database
- Socket.io for WebSockets
- Redis for caching
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- AWS for deployment

## Progress Log
- Started: 2026-03-XX 08:00
- Implemented WebSocket server with Socket.io
- Created real-time data handlers for analytics events
- Optimized PostgreSQL queries with materialized views
- Set up Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Added real-time updating components to dashboard
- Wrote Cypress tests for dashboard functionality

## Code Highlight
```javascript
// server.js - WebSocket implementation for real-time analytics
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const { Server } = require('socket.io');
const { getAnalyticsUpdates } = require('./services/analytics');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server, {
  cors: {
    origin: process.env.CLIENT_URL,
    methods: ['GET', 'POST']
  }
});

// Socket.io connection handling
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('Client connected', socket.id);
  
  // Join user-specific room for targeted updates
  socket.on('join-dashboard', async (userId) => {
    socket.join(`user-${userId}`);
    console.log(`User ${userId} joined their dashboard room`);
    
    // Send initial data
    const initialData = await getAnalyticsUpdates(userId);
    socket.emit('dashboard-data', initialData);
  });
  
  // Handle disconnect
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected', socket.id);
  });
});

// Set up analytics data change listener
setupAnalyticsChangeListener((update) => {
  // Broadcast to affected users
  update.userIds.forEach(userId => {
    io.to(`user-${userId}`).emit('analytics-update', update.data);
  });
});

server.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${process.env.PORT}`);
});
```

## Challenges Faced
- Managing WebSocket connections at scale required careful architecture
- SQL queries for analytics were initially too slow for real-time dashboards
- Had to implement proper error handling for WebSocket disconnections
- Needed to refactor frontend components to handle real-time updates

## Learning Resources Used
- Socket.io documentation on rooms and namespaces
- PostgreSQL performance tuning guide
- "High Performance Browser Networking" by Ilya Grigorik
- Launch School materials on database optimization

## Reflections
- WebSockets provide a much better user experience for real-time data
- Materialized views significantly improved query performance for analytics
- Redis caching was essential for handling high-traffic periods
- End-to-end testing catches issues that unit tests miss

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Implement rate limiting for WebSocket connections
- Add reconnection logic for better reliability
- Create admin dashboard for system monitoring
- Write documentation for the real-time features
