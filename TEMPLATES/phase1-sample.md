# Day X - Phase 1: Python Backend (Week XX)

## Today's Focus
- [ ] Primary goal: Build a REST API endpoint for user authentication
- [ ] Secondary goal: Write unit tests for the authentication flow
- [ ] Stretch goal: Implement JWT token refresh mechanism

## Launch School Connection
- Current course: LS175 - Networked Applications
- Concept application: RESTful API design patterns and authentication flows

## Project Context
This Python backend project is part of a social media analytics platform. Today's work focuses on the authentication service that will be used across the entire platform.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.10
- Flask framework
- pytest for testing
- SQLAlchemy for database interactions
- bcrypt for password hashing

## Progress Log
- Started: 2025-04-XX 08:30
- Set up basic Flask application structure
- Created user model with SQLAlchemy
- Implemented password hashing with bcrypt
- Created `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` endpoints
- Added JWT token generation
- Wrote basic unit tests for authentication flow

## Code Highlight
```python
def generate_auth_token(user_id, expiration=3600):
    """Generate a JWT authentication token.
    
    Args:
        user_id: The user's ID to encode in the token
        expiration: Token validity in seconds (default: 1 hour)
        
    Returns:
        str: The encoded JWT token
    """
    payload = {
        'exp': datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(seconds=expiration),
        'iat': datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
        'sub': user_id
    }
    return jwt.encode(
        payload,
        current_app.config.get('SECRET_KEY'),
        algorithm='HS256'
    )
```

## Challenges Faced
- Initially struggled with SQLAlchemy session management in the Flask application
- Had to refactor the password hashing function to handle None values gracefully
- Needed to research best practices for JWT token storage and security

## Learning Resources Used
- Flask documentation on application factories
- SQLAlchemy documentation on session management
- Launch School material on RESTful API design
- "Flask Web Development" by Miguel Grinberg (Chapter 8)

## Reflections
- The Flask application factory pattern provides a clean way to configure applications
- Proper password hashing is critical for security; never store plaintext passwords
- JWT tokens should be short-lived with a refresh mechanism for better security
- Plan to implement role-based permissions in the authentication system next

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Add role-based access control
- Write integration tests for the complete authentication flow
- Document the API endpoints with Swagger/OpenAPI
