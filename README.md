2. **Click the "Use this template" button**: Look for the green button near the top of the repository page.

3. **Create a new repository**:
   - Enter a name for your repository (e.g., "my-coding-challenge")
   - Choose visibility (public or private)
   - Click "Create repository from template"

4. **Clone your new repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `ccstart`  | Start the day's coding session in tmux                |
| `cclog`    | Record your progress in the weekly log                |
| `ccpush`   | Commit changes and increment the day counter          |
| `ccstatus` | Show your overall challenge progress                  |
| `ccconfig` | View or modify your configuration                     |
| `ccupdate` | Update scripts to the latest version                  |
| `ccuninstall` | Remove scripts and configuration                   |

## Daily Workflow

1. **Start your day**: Run `ccstart` to set up your environment
2. **Write code**: Work on your daily project
3. **Document**: Fill in your README.md with goals and reflections
4. **Log progress**: Run `cclog` to update your weekly log
5. **Commit**: Run `ccpush` to commit changes and increment day counter

## Prerequisites

- **Ruby**: For script execution
- **zsh**: As your shell
- **git**: For version control

Optional but recommended:
- **tmux**: For terminal session management
- **neovim** or **vim**: For editing files

## New Feature: Customization

You can now customize the 6/7 Coding Challenge to your preferences:

```zsh
# View current configuration
ccconfig

# Update configuration interactively
ccconfig --interactive

# Set a specific configuration value
ccconfig --set user.github_username=yourusername
ccconfig --set preferences.editor=vim
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `user.name` | Your name | System username |
| `user.github_username` | GitHub username | (empty) |
| `user.github_email` | Email for git commits | (empty) |
| `paths.base_dir` | Project directory | `~/projects/6-7-coding-challenge` |
| `paths.bin_dir` | Scripts directory | `~/bin` |
| `preferences.editor` | Preferred text editor | (auto-detected) |
| `preferences.use_tmux` | Whether to use tmux | `true` if installed |
| `preferences.auto_push` | Auto-push to GitHub | `true` |
| `preferences.display_colors` | Show colorized output | `true` |

## New Feature: Retroactive Logging

You can now log entries for previous days:

```zsh
# Log the current day (normal usage)
cclog

# Log a specific previous day
cclog 5  # Logs day 5 specifically
```

This is useful if you forget to log on a particular day.

## Project Philosophy

This challenge follows several key principles:

1. **Mastery over Surface Knowledge**: Focus on deep understanding
2. **Consistency over Intensity**: Regular, moderate practice
3. **Application over Theory**: Hands-on projects
4. **Documentation over Silent Progress**: Regular reflection
5. **Structure over Randomness**: Organized approach
6. **Rest as Essential**: Recognition that regular rest enhances productivity
