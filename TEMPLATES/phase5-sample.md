# Day X - Phase 5: ML Finance Applications (Week XX)

## Today's Focus
- [ ] Primary goal: Implement sentiment analysis model for financial news
- [ ] Secondary goal: Create feature pipeline for market data preprocessing
- [ ] Stretch goal: Develop backtesting framework for trading strategies

## Launch School Connection
- Current course: Independent study - Machine Learning for Finance
- Concept application: Natural language processing and time series analysis

## Project Context
This ML finance application is focused on building predictive models for financial markets. Today's work focuses on sentiment analysis of financial news and its correlation with market movements.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.11
- PyTorch for deep learning
- pandas and numpy for data manipulation
- Hugging Face transformers for NLP
- FastAPI for model serving
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Docker for containerization

## Progress Log
- Started: 2026-08-XX 07:30
- Collected financial news data from multiple sources
- Preprocessed text data for sentiment analysis
- Fine-tuned FinBERT model on financial news corpus
- Created feature extraction pipeline for market data
- Implemented backtesting framework for strategy evaluation
- Built API endpoints for model predictions

## Code Highlight

## Challenges Faced
- Finding high-quality labeled data for financial sentiment analysis
- Handling class imbalance in the sentiment dataset
- Determining appropriate thresholds for trading signals
- Implementing efficient backtesting for multiple strategies

## Learning Resources Used
- "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado
- PyTorch documentation on fine-tuning transformer models
- Papers on sentiment analysis impact on market movements
- Coursera "Machine Learning for Trading" course materials

## Reflections
- Financial news has significant but delayed impact on market movements
- Transformer models perform well for financial sentiment, but domain-specific fine-tuning is crucial
- Feature engineering is as important as model selection for financial data
- Backtesting requires careful consideration of look-ahead bias

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Integrate market data with sentiment signals
- Implement multi-factor model combining technical and sentiment indicators
- Create visualization dashboard for model insights
- Set up continuous monitoring for model drift
