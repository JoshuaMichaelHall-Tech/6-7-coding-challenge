# Day X - Phase 2: JavaScript Frontend (Week XX)

## Today's Focus
- [ ] Primary goal: Implement user dashboard with React components
- [ ] Secondary goal: Create data visualization for user activity metrics
- [ ] Stretch goal: Add dark mode theme toggle with CSS variables

## Launch School Connection
- Current course: LS350 - Frontend Applications
- Concept application: Component-based architecture and state management

## Project Context
This JavaScript frontend project is part of a social media analytics platform. Today's work focuses on the user dashboard that will display key metrics and analytics.

## Tools & Technologies
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for data fetching
- D3.js for data visualizations
- Vite as build tool

## Progress Log
- Started: 2025-07-XX 09:15
- Set up React component structure for dashboard
- Created responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
- Implemented data fetching with React Query
- Built activity timeline visualization with D3.js
- Added user preferences with localStorage persistence
- Implemented theme switching with CSS variables

## Code Highlight
```javascript
// Dashboard.tsx - Data fetching and visualization setup
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
import { BarChart } from './charts/BarChart';
import { fetchUserMetrics } from '../api/metrics';

export const Dashboard = ({ userId }) => {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(
    ['userMetrics', userId],
    () => fetchUserMetrics(userId),
    {
      staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
      refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
    }
  );
  
  if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (error) return <ErrorMessage message={error.message} />;
  
  return (
    <div className="dashboard-container p-4 md:p-6 grid gap-4 grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
      <MetricCard title="Engagement Rate" value={data.engagementRate} />
      <MetricCard title="Total Followers" value={data.followers} />
      <MetricCard title="Total Posts" value={data.postCount} />
      
      <div className="col-span-1 md:col-span-2 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Activity Timeline</h3>
        <BarChart data={data.activityData} />
      </div>
      
      {/* Additional dashboard components */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Challenges Faced
- D3.js integration with React required careful management of refs and lifecycle methods
- Had to implement responsive design for various device sizes
- Managing loading and error states across multiple data fetching components
- Theme switching required refactoring CSS to use variables

## Learning Resources Used
- React Query documentation on caching strategies
- D3.js examples for time-series visualizations
- Launch School material on component lifecycle
- "React Cookbook" by Carlos Santana (Chapter 5 - Data Fetching)

## Reflections
- React Query significantly simplifies data fetching and caching
- D3.js is powerful but requires careful integration with React's lifecycle
- CSS variables make theme switching much more maintainable
- Component composition helps manage complexity in large dashboards

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Add unit tests for dashboard components
- Implement dashboard settings for user customization
- Create additional visualization components for other metrics
- Add animations for smoother user experience
