# Day 1 - Phase 1: Python Backend (Week 01)

## Today's Focus
- [ ] Primary goal: Set up Python development environment
- [ ] Secondary goal: Begin Launch School Python track
- [ ] Stretch goal: Create initial project structure for social media finance project

## Launch School Connection
- Current course: Launch School Python Track
- Concept application: Environment setup and Python basics

## Progress Log
- Started: 2025-03-31 08:00
- Set up Python 3.10 with pyenv
- Configured virtual environment for isolation
- Installed essential packages (pytest, black, pylint)
- Completed initial Launch School Python exercises
- Created directory structure for social media finance project

## Reflections
- Python's syntax feels cleaner than Ruby's in some ways, but I miss Ruby's elegant blocks
- The Launch School Python track seems well-organized and follows the same mastery-based approach
- Setting up a proper Python development environment is more involved than Ruby's, but provides better isolation
- Excited about using Python's rich data analysis ecosystem for the social media finance project
- Tomorrow I'll focus on Python fundamentals and data structures
