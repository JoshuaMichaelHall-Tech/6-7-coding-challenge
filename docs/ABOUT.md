# About the 6/7 Coding Challenge
Part of the [6/7 Coding Challenge](https://github.com/JoshuaMichaelHall-Tech/6-7-coding-challenge) documentation. See [Documentation Index](https://github.com/JoshuaMichaelHall-Tech/6-7-coding-challenge/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md) for all guides.

## What Is It?

The 6/7 Coding Challenge is a personal commitment to code for 500 days, six days a week (Monday through Saturday), while observing the Sabbath rest on Sundays. It's designed to build programming mastery through consistent practice while maintaining a sustainable pace that respects religious observance.

## Why This Challenge?

The traditional "100 days of code" or similar challenges often encourage daily coding without breaks. This modified challenge acknowledges the importance of regular rest while still maintaining the discipline and consistency that builds skills.

### Benefits:

1. **Skill Development**: Consistent practice of programming fundamentals
2. **Portfolio Building**: Creation of numerous projects across different domains
3. **Career Advancement**: Demonstrated commitment to software engineering excellence
4. **Structured Learning**: Alignment with Launch School's mastery-based approach
5. **Sustainable Pace**: Prevention of burnout through regular rest
6. **Value Alignment**: Honoring religious observance while pursuing professional growth

## Challenge Philosophy

This challenge follows several key principles:

1. **Mastery over Surface Knowledge**: Focus on deep understanding rather than superficial exposure
2. **Consistency over Intensity**: Regular, moderate practice is more effective than sporadic intense sessions
3. **Application over Theory**: Hands-on projects that apply concepts learned through Launch School
4. **Documentation over Silent Progress**: Regular reflection and public sharing of the journey
5. **Structure over Randomness**: Organized phases targeting specific skill areas
6. **Rest as Essential**: Recognition that regular rest enhances productivity and creativity

## Five Phase Structure

The challenge is divided into five phases:

### Phase 1: Python Backend (March 31 - June 29, 2025)
Building a strong foundation in server-side programming with Python, focusing on fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and web servers while completing Launch School's Python track through course 189 and Algebra 2 coursework.

### Phase 2: JavaScript Frontend (June 30 - November 2, 2025)
Developing frontend skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, including modern frameworks and interactive visualization while advancing mathematical knowledge and building a diverse portfolio of web applications.

### Phase 3: Capstone Prep (November 3 - January 4, 2026)
Preparing for Launch School's Capstone program by focusing on networking, strengthening social media presence, and solidifying technical foundations while applying for the program.

### Phase 4: Capstone (January 5 - June 28, 2026)
Participating in Launch School's Capstone program, working on real-world projects with a team while developing specialized technical expertise and preparing for technical interviews.

### Phase 5: Career Development (June 29, 2026 onward)
Specializing in machine learning applications for finance, preparing for future career goals in the ML finance sector while expanding investments and developing business opportunities.

## Launch School Integration

This challenge is designed to complement the Launch School curriculum:

- Challenge projects apply concepts learned in Launch School courses
- Weekly planning aligns challenge work with current Launch School material
- Project structure matches Launch School's emphasis on mastery
- Challenge phases build toward career goals beyond Launch School

## Daily Structure

The challenge incorporates a structured daily schedule:

- **5:00-5:30** - Devotions
- **5:30-6:00** - ANKI/Biking/Stretching
- **6:00-9:00** - Study Session 1 (60 minutes on, 5 minutes off)
- **10:00-1:00** - Study Session 2 (55 minutes on, 5 minutes off)
- **2:00-5:00** - Study Session 3 (50 minutes on, 10 minutes off)
- **5:00-6:30** - Math Lessons (odd days)
- **Evening** - Daily Kata/Equivalent (Rotating Languages: Ruby/Python, Bash/SQL, HTML/CSS)
- **9:00** - Bedtime

### Weekly Structure
- Complete one course module
- Create mind maps for learned concepts
- Update 6/7 Challenge progress
- Review and adjust learning plan

## Measuring Success

Success in this challenge is measured by:

1. **Consistency**: Completing the required days of coding
2. **Portfolio Growth**: Number and quality of projects created
3. **Skill Development**: Mastery of targeted technologies
4. **Documentation**: Quality of reflections and logs
5. **Knowledge Integration**: Application of Launch School concepts
6. **Career Advancement**: Progress toward software engineering and ML finance goals

## Documentation

For a complete implementation plan including website integration, social media strategy, and article publishing guidelines, see the [Website & Social Media Integration Guide](./docs/website-social-guide.md) in the docs directory.

## Challenge Origins

This challenge was inspired by traditional coding challenges but modified to align with personal values and career goals. It combines elements of:

- Traditional "X days of code" challenges
- Launch School's mastery-based learning approach
- Religious observance of the Sabbath
- Long-term career planning for software engineering and ML finance
