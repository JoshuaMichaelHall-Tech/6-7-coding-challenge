  - Concept application: Modular code organization

- **Progress Log**:
  - Completed functions module
  - Learned about Python modules and packages
  - Finished 2 Algebra 2 lessons
  - Created initial data models for social media finance project

- **Reflections**:
  - Python's function parameters are more explicit than Ruby's
  - The module system makes code organization straightforward
  - Finding a good balance between Launch School work and project work

### Day 4
- **Today's Focus**:
  - Primary goal: Study Python OOP concepts
  - Secondary goal: Continue Algebra 2 lessons
  - Stretch goal: Implement basic models for social media finance project

- **Launch School Connection**:
  - Current course: Launch School Python Track - OOP
  - Concept application: Object-oriented design

- **Progress Log**:
  - Studied Python classes and inheritance
  - Implemented class-based models for finance project
  - Completed another Algebra 2 lesson
  - Practiced Python syntax with 5 coding challenges

- **Reflections**:
  - Python's OOP is less central to the language than Ruby's
  - The explicit `self` parameter makes method definitions clearer
  - Making good progress on the new daily schedule

### Day 5
- **Today's Focus**:
  - Primary goal: Learn Python error handling
  - Secondary goal: Work on Algebra 2 problems
  - Stretch goal: Add error handling to finance project

- **Progress Log**:
  - Completed error handling module
  - Implemented try/except blocks in finance project
  - Solved 10 Algebra 2 practice problems
  - Reviewed the week's Python concepts

- **Reflections**:
  - Python's exception handling is similar to Ruby's but with different syntax
  - The new study session timing (60/55/50 minutes) is working well
  - Finding the mathematics review helpful for algorithmic thinking

### Day 6
- **Today's Focus**:
  - Primary goal: Complete Python first module assessment
  - Secondary goal: Review the week's progress
  - Stretch goal: Plan next week's goals
