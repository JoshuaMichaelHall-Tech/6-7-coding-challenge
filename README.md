# 6/7 Coding Challenge

A personal commitment to code for 500 days, six days a week (Monday through Saturday), while observing the Sabbath rest on Sundays.

## What Is This?

The 6/7 Coding Challenge is a structured approach to mastering software engineering through consistent practice while respecting the importance of regular rest. The "6/7" represents coding for six days each week while resting on the seventh (Sabbath).

## Current Phase
**Phase 1: Python Backend** (March 31 - June 29, 2025)

Building a strong foundation in server-side programming with Python, focusing on fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and web servers while completing Launch School's Python track through course 189 and Algebra 2 coursework.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```zsh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/joshuamichaelhall-tech/6-7-coding-challenge.git
cd 6-7-coding-challenge

# Install the Ruby-based setup script
mkdir -p ~/bin
cp scripts/cc-installer.rb ~/bin/
chmod +x ~/bin/cc-installer.rb

# Run the installer
ruby ~/bin/cc-installer.rb

# Source your .zshrc or restart your terminal
source ~/.zshrc

# Start your first day
ccstart
```

## Core Commands

After installation, these commands will be available:

| Command    | Description                                           |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `ccstart`  | Start the day's coding session in tmux                |
| `cclog`    | Record your progress in the weekly log                |
| `ccpush`   | Commit changes and increment the day counter          |
| `ccstatus` | Show your overall challenge progress                  |
| `ccconfig` | View or modify your configuration                     |
| `ccupdate` | Update scripts to the latest version                  |
| `ccuninstall` | Remove scripts and configuration                   |

## Daily Workflow

1. **Start your day**: Run `ccstart` to set up your environment
2. **Write code**: Work on your daily project
3. **Document**: Fill in your README.md with goals and reflections
4. **Log progress**: Run `cclog` to update your weekly log
5. **Commit**: Run `ccpush` to commit changes and increment day counter

## Five Phase Structure

The challenge is divided into five phases:

### Phase 1: Python Backend (March 31 - June 29, 2025)
Building a strong foundation in server-side programming with Python, focusing on fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and web servers.

### Phase 2: JavaScript Frontend (June 30 - November 2, 2025)
Developing frontend skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, including modern frameworks and interactive visualization.

### Phase 3: Capstone Prep (November 3 - January 4, 2026)
Preparing for Launch School's Capstone program, networking, and solidifying technical foundations.

### Phase 4: Capstone (January 5 - June 28, 2026)
Participating in Launch School's Capstone program, working on real-world projects with a team.

### Phase 5: Career Development (June 29, 2026 onward)
Specializing in machine learning applications for finance, preparing for future career goals in the ML finance sector.

## Project Philosophy

This challenge follows several key principles:

1. **Mastery over Surface Knowledge**: Focus on deep understanding
2. **Consistency over Intensity**: Regular, moderate practice
3. **Application over Theory**: Hands-on projects
4. **Documentation over Silent Progress**: Regular reflection
5. **Structure over Randomness**: Organized approach
6. **Rest as Essential**: Recognition that regular rest enhances productivity
