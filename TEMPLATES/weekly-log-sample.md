## Daily Logs

### Day XXX
#### Today's Focus:
- Primary goal: Implement backend authentication API endpoints
- Secondary goal: Set up JWT token generation and validation
- Stretch goal: Add refresh token mechanism

#### Launch School Connection:
- Current course: LS175 - Networked Applications
- Concept application: RESTful API design and authentication flows

#### Progress Log:
- Set up Express.js backend with TypeScript
- Created user model with MongoDB schema
- Implemented password hashing with bcrypt
- Built authentication endpoints for login and registration
- Added JWT token generation for successful authentication
- Implemented validation middleware for protected routes

#### Reflections:
- JWT implementation requires careful consideration of security implications
- TypeScript adds significant benefits for API development through type safety
- Express middleware pattern provides clean separation of concerns
- Need to implement refresh tokens for better security

### Day XXX+1
#### Today's Focus:
- Primary goal: Create frontend authentication components
- Secondary goal: Implement protected routes in React
- Stretch goal: Add form validation with error messages

#### Launch School Connection:
- Current course: LS350 - Frontend Applications
- Concept application: State management and form handling

#### Progress Log:
- Created login and registration forms with React
- Implemented form validation with Formik and Yup
- Set up authentication context for React app
- Added protected route components
- Implemented token storage in localStorage
- Created authentication service for API calls

#### Reflections:
- Form validation is critical for good user experience
- React Context API provides clean solution for authentication state
- Need to consider security implications of token storage
- Should implement automatic logout on token expiration

### Day XXX+2
#### Today's Focus:
- Primary goal: Integrate frontend and backend authentication
- Secondary goal: Add error handling and loading states
- Stretch goal: Implement user profile management

#### Launch School Connection:
- Current course: LS350 - Frontend Applications
- Concept application: API integration and error handling

#### Progress Log:
- Connected React authentication forms to API endpoints
- Implemented loading states for authentication processes
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Created user profile page with data fetching
- Added logout functionality
- Tested complete authentication flow

#### Reflections:
- Error handling is equally important as the happy path
- Loading states significantly improve user experience
- Token validation needs to happen on both client and server
- Keeping authentication state in sync across components is challenging

### Day XXX+3
#### Today's Focus:
- Primary goal: Implement data visualization components
- Secondary goal: Set up data fetching with React Query
- Stretch goal: Add real-time updates with WebSockets

#### Launch School Connection:
- Current course: LS350 - Frontend Applications
- Concept application: Data visualization and async data management

#### Progress Log:
- Created dashboard layout with responsive design
- Implemented chart components using Chart.js
- Set up data fetching with React Query
- Added caching and refetching strategies
- Created data transformation utilities
- Added basic real-time updates with Socket.io

#### Reflections:
- React Query significantly simplifies data fetching logic
- Chart.js provides good balance between flexibility and ease of use
- Data transformation before visualization is often necessary
- WebSockets require careful state management with React

### Day XXX+4
#### Today's Focus:
- Primary goal: Add backend data aggregation for dashboard
- Secondary goal: Optimize database queries for analytics
- Stretch goal: Implement data export functionality

#### Launch School Connection:
- Current course: LS175 - Networked Applications
- Concept application: Data aggregation and API optimization

#### Progress Log:
- Created API endpoints for dashboard data
- Implemented MongoDB aggregation pipelines
- Added caching layer with Redis
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Created CSV and JSON export endpoints
- Added rate limiting for API protection

#### Reflections:
- MongoDB aggregation framework is powerful but has steep learning curve
- Caching is essential for performance with complex queries
- Proper indexes dramatically improve query performance
- Rate limiting is important for API security and stability

### Day XXX+5
#### Today's Focus:
- Primary goal: Set up automated testing for backend
- Secondary goal: Implement frontend unit tests
- Stretch goal: Add end-to-end testing with Cypress

#### Launch School Connection:
- Current course: LS195 - Advanced JavaScript Topics
- Concept application: Testing methodologies and CI/CD

#### Progress Log:
- Set up Jest for backend testing
- Created unit tests for authentication services
- Added integration tests for API endpoints
- Implemented React Testing Library tests for components
- Set up Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for CI

#### Reflections:
- Testing pyramid approach balances coverage and speed
- Mock services are essential for isolated unit testing
- End-to-end tests catch integration issues missed by unit tests
- CI/CD automation ensures tests run consistently
